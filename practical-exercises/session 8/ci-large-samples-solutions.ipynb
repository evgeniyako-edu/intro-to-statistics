When the data follows a normal distribution we could use confidence intervals based on standardized statistics to estimate the mean.\r\n","\r\n","But suppose the data $X_1, X_2,...,X_n$ is drawn from a distribution that may not be normal. If the distribution has finite mean and variance and if $n$ is sufficiently large, then the central limit theorem suggests that we can still use normal distribution to approximate the distribution of the standardized statistic:\r\n","\r\n","$\\frac{(\\bar{X}-\\mu)\\sqrt{n}}{s} \\approx N(0,1)$\r\n","\r\n","So, for large $n$, the $(1 − \\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\mu$ is *approximately*\r\n","\r\n","$[\\bar{X}-\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}z_{1-\\alpha/2} ; \\bar{X}+\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}z_{1-\\alpha/2}]$\r\n","\r\n","But how good is such an approximation?
